<section id="tmp-preamble">

### 0\. Preamble

Software is deeply embedded in all aspects of our lives and it is important that it empower, rather than restrict us. Free Software gives everybody the rights to use, understand, adapt and share software. These rights help support other fundamental freedoms like freedom of speech, press and privacy.

Development of Free Software can follow many patterns. In some cases whole development is handled by a sole programmer or a small group of people. But usually, the creation and maintenance of software is a complex process that requires the contribution of many individuals. This also affects who owns the rights to the software. In the latter case, rights in software are owned jointly by a great number of individuals.

To tackle this issue some projects require a full copyright assignment to be signed by all contributors. The problem with such assignments is that they often lack checks and balances that would protect the contributors from potential abuse of power from the new copyright holder.

FSFE’s Fiduciary License Agreement (FLA) was created by the Free Software Foundation Europe e.V. with just that in mind – to concentrate all deciding power within one entity and prevent fragmentation of rights on one hand, while on the other preventing that single entity from abusing its power. The main aim is to ensure that the software covered under the FLA will forever remain Free Software.

This process only serves for the transfer of economic rights. So-called moral rights (e.g. authors right to be identified as author) remain with the original author(s) and are inalienable.

</section>

### How to use this <span id="tmp-how-to">FLA</span>

If You are an employee and have created the Contribution as part of your employment, You need to have Your employer approve this Agreement or sign the Entity version of this document. If You do not own the Copyright in the entire work of authorship, any other author of the Contribution should also sign this – in any event, please contact Us at <span id="tmp-project-email">opensource@jjconsulting.com.br</span>

**"Legal Entity"** means an entity that is not a natural person.

**"Affiliate"** means any other Legal Entity that controls, is controlled by, or under common control with that Legal Entity.
