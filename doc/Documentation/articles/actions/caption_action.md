## Caption Action

The *Caption* function will be used to add a caption to your table. For example, if a user table has a column with their respective statuses, it will be possible to add a description for each status.

It is important that the status record component is marked as ComboBox so that the *Show Icon* option can be enabled and the desired options can be registered. The image below will show the expected configuration.
