#### Additional Settings - Data File

- **Folder Path**: Defines which folder the imported files will be stored in. If the variable {app.path} is used, the default application path will be applied.

- **Allowed Extensions**: Allows you to choose which file extensions are accepted by the system. The extensions are: txt, csv, xlsx.

- **Max File Size**: Sets the maximum allowed size for each imported file.

- **Show Files in Gallery**: After clicking "Manage Files," a new upload tab will open. When the "Show Files in Gallery" option is enabled, a preview of the file will be displayed below the import area. If the option is not enabled, only file information such as *Name*, *Size*, and *Last Modified* will be shown.

- **Drag and Drop**: Allows enabling file import simply by dragging the file directly to the import area.

- **Allow Multiple Files**: Allows multiple files to be imported in a single entry.

- **Export as Link**: This option will change the name of the attachment within the exported file when exporting through the grid.

- **Allow Pasting Files**: Allows the content of the file to be pasted to perform the import, or just a part of the content. It is not necessary to insert the entire file.

- **Show Upload Outside Modal**: If this option is enabled, there will be no "Manage Files" option, and the import field will be displayed alongside the information after clicking edit.
